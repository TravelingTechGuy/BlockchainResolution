# Resolution - resolve .crypto and .eth domains

This demo uses Unstoppable Domains' [Resolution library](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/resolution) to resolve `.eth`, `.crypto` domains into ETH addreses, and/or IPFS URLS.

To use the library, you need an Infura project URI:

1. Go to [infura.io](https://infura.io), register for free, and create a project.
1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the line `INFURA_URI=<my URI...>`
3. Run the project `npm start`
